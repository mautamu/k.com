## Projects that I am currently working on or contribute to:

- [College Football Risk](https://collegefootballrisk.com/): An online multiplayer game, similar to Risk, where the goal is for you to work with other players who support your College Football ([FBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Football_Bowl_Subdivision)) team to take as many territories on a map of North America as possible.
- [LeftWM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Football_Bowl_Subdivision): A tiling window manager for the X11 system, written in Rust with a goal of first-in-class theme capabilities, stability, and performance. I am the primary author of the `leftwm-theme` and `leftwm-check` utilities.

## Past projects:

- [W5AC](https://w5ac.tamu.edu/): A Texas A&M student organization, founded in 1912, that practices the art of amateur radio and elmers (mentors) new amateur radio operators in the art while giving back to the campus community.
- [Texas A&M Science Olympiad Society](https://tamuscioly.com/): A Texas A&M student organization that hosts an invitational annual science competitions for middle school students and contributes to the running of state-level competitions. As a co-founder of the society, I led it through its formative years and oversaw execution of the inaugural tournament hosted on 8 February, 2020.
